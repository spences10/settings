# Settings of all the things

This is my own opinionated list of settings I use for my coding.

So far I have listed out the following:

VSCode

[Chocolatey]('../../windows/chocolatey.md')

[Terminal](terminal.md)

[npm](npm.md)

[Chrome](chrome.md)

~~I use [Monoid](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid) for terminal and editor üëç~~

I use Victor Mono
