# Settings of all the things

This is my own opinionated list of settings I use for my coding.

So far I have listed out the following:

[VSCode](vscode.md)

[Chocolatey](chocolate.md)

[Terminal](terminal.md)

[npm](npm.md)

[Chrome](chrome.md)

I use [Monoid](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid) for terminal and editor 👍
